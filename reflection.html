        <p>I like this class and the teacher even though I know nothing about coding. Its a fun class 
            and doesn't have much work. 
        </p>
        <p>I was put in this class llate and was way behind but I enjoyed learning about making websites. 
            They are more complex than people think and are really hard to code.
        </p>
        <p>I also enjoyed learning about how customizable websites and code are. If you
            are good at it, you can make anything do anything.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, I enjoyed learning how much better most kids are than me when it comes
            to coding. Its way too confusing for me. I have no idea how to do anything and would have 
            failed this class if Murry graded things harder.
